After performing research on licenses, we have figured out the following licenses MIT License, Apache License 2.0, GNU General Public License (GPL) might be best suitable for Face tagging project.
MIT License is simple and mostly used for commercial purposes. It allows users to modify, distribute, and use the software with very few restrictions. Apache License is another widely used software license which also provides patent protection. It includes some additional requirements and limitations compared to the MIT License. In Apache License, as long as the software is utilized in accordance with the license conditions, anybody who receives a copy of the software under the license is given a patent license from the contributors to produce, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and distribute the software. The GPL is an option to consider if we wish to guarantee that any alterations or enhancements to our software should be open-source. Any derivative works must be provided under the same GPL license as well.
Among all these, I feel that MIT License would suit well for our project because, anyone may use, modify, distribute without many limitations. This promotes broad adoption and cooperation. The program can be used both for business and non-commercial purposes under the license. Thus, without having to pay royalties or request additional rights, people and organizations can use our face tagging machine learning project in their own applications. The program is given "as is" and without any warranty or guarantee, as stated in the disclaimer of liability included in the MIT License. This can assist in shielding us from potential legal obligations.
The MIT License's flexibility provides involvement in contributions from the community. Our face tagging project can modified and expanded by developers, which might result in enhancements, problem corrections, or new features that benefit the entire community. Commercial use is not constrained by the MIT License. Our face tagging technology can be incorporated by individuals and businesses without requiring them to enter into extra license agreements or pay royalties.
